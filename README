Selected results from LES of cavitating jet from a step nozzle. Uses a multiphase formulation for liquid, vapor and air. Liquid and gas (vapor and air)  are resolved using volume of fluid type formulation with algebric (numerical) interface sharpening.

Simulation peformed with OpenFOAM v5.

   "isoAlpha.mp4" iso-contour 0.5 of liquid volume fraction. Inside the injector the interface is between liquid (water) and vapor (water), while outside the injector, the interface is between liquid and air.
